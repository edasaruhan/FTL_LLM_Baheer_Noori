# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Sentiment Analysis on Climate Action

This project aims to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to perform sentiment analysis on text related to climate action, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action. By fine-tuning a pre-trained model, we aim to improve its performance in classifying sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) in climate-related texts.

## Project Objectives

- **Understand** the process of fine-tuning large language models.
- **Improve** the model's performance on a specific task (sentiment analysis).
- **Evaluate** and compare model performance before and after fine-tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of text samples related to climate action and annotated with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). The dataset is pre-processed for training the LLM.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install transformers torch scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
