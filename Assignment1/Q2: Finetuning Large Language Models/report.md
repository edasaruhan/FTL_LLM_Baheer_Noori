# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Sentiment Analysis Project Report

## Introduction

This project explores the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) to improve performance on sentiment analysis
tasks related to climate action, contributing to SDG 13: Climate Action.
The goal is to enhance the model's ability to classify sentiments in climate-related texts.

## Objectives

1. Understand the fine-tuning process for LLMs.
2. Improve the model's performance in sentiment classification tasks.
3. Evaluate the model's performance before and after fine-tuning.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset consists of text samples related to climate action, annotated with sentiment labels
(positive, negative, neutral). The dataset was loaded, and basic exploratory data analysis was performed
to understand its structure and characteristics.

#### Data Visualization

- **Distribution of Sentiments**: Visualizations were created to show the distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset.
- **Text Length Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of text lengths to inform data preprocessing steps.

### Dataset Preparation

The dataset was preprocessed to be suitable for sentiment analysis. This included:

- **Tokenization**: Using a tokenizer compatible with the chosen model.
- **Padding and Truncation**: Ensuring uniform input length for the model.
- **Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and test sets.

### Model Selection

The `bert-base-uncased` model was selected for fine-tuning due to its effectiveness in NLP tasks and
availability of pre-trained weights.

### Fine-Tuning Process

1. **Define Training Arguments**: Set parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
2. **Fine-Tune the Model**: The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset using a suitable optimizer and loss function.

### Evaluation

The fine-tuned model was evaluated on a test set using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score. The performance was
compared before and after fine-tuning to assess improvements.

## Results

The fine-tuned model showed a significant improvement in accuracy and F1-score compared to the pre-trained model,
indicating successful adaptation to the sentiment analysis task.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a large language model for sentiment analysis in
climate-related text. Fine-tuning resulted in a notable improvement in performance, making the model more suitable
for specific tasks.

## Future Work

- **Expand the Dataset**: Use a larger and more diverse dataset for better model generalization.
- **Experiment with Different Models**: Explore other pre-trained models and architectures.
- **Real-World Application**: Apply the model to real-world data to automatically classify sentiments in climate-related content.
