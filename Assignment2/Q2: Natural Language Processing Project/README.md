# Natural Language Processing Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. The project is divided into two main parts:

## Part 1: Explore and Compare Text Embeddings
- Investigate different types of text embeddings, including Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT.
- Apply these embeddings to a text classification task (e.g., sentiment analysis or topic categorization).
- Compare the performance of the various embedding types using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Document findings and provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each embedding type.

## Part 2: Build a Semantic Search Engine (Optional)
- Utilize the text embeddings from Part 1 to create embeddings for a large corpus of documents.
- Store these embeddings in a vector database.
- Implement a search interface that allows users to input queries and receive relevant document results.
- Provide case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the vector database and semantic search engine.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd NLP_Project`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download the necessary datasets and embeddings (e.g., GloVe, BERT).

## Usage Instructions
- To run the classification task, execute the `nlp_project_code.py` file.
- To use the semantic search engine, follow the instructions in the code file to input queries and get document results.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project should be placed in the `data` directory (not included in this repository).
- Ensure the dataset has the necessary columns (e.g., `text_column` for text and `label_column` for labels).

## Results
- The results of the classification tasks, including performance metrics and comparisons, are printed in the console output.
- The semantic search engine will return relevant document results based on the input query.
